      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Ron. I'm a Dutch Full-stack Javascript Developer who recently finished his Bootcamp at <a href="https://salt.study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&lt;/salt&gt;</a>. I recently made the switch from being a UX/UI designer to be a developer. Well, not entirely. I think all the skills I learned are still very valuable even as a developer. And It would be my dream to find a job where I can add value to both my backgrounds.
    </p>
      <p>
        I started as a UX designer as I'm always curious about why and how things are build and work. That curiosity hasn't faded. But I also got interested in how the things I designed got build, and if you take a good look at how the discipline of design evolves, you quickly see that design and development keep growing toward each other. A combination of these and other factors made me jump ship. I came across a great opportunity to get my feet wet in the development world at &lt;/salt&gt; and decided to give it a chance.
      </p >
      <p>
        Right now I'm ready to start this new adventure. My first steps are rebuilding my portfolio. This space used to be a portfolio focused on UX/UI design, but right now I'm transforming it into something new. I start small and easy with blogging about how I find my way in this new career path and plan to build it out into more. Into what I don't know yet, a digital playground, my only archives, it can be anything. Because the best way to keep developing yourself and learn new skills is by playing around and building cool stuff.
