Staying up-to-date in a fast pace industry as ours isn't always easy. In the following blog posts, I will explore the several ways of keeping up with all the innovations and developments.

## Twitter
The main tool I use to stay up-to-date is Twitter. It's a powerful tool to get information about new- developments, tools, projects, or frameworks. Itâ€™s easy to quickly scan your timeline between meetings or during breaks. I will explain how I use it and my methods for following people that keep me up-to-date.

### Not another follow these people list
No, this won't be yet another list of people you should follow. Because who you could follow depends on your interests and preferences. Thus this varies from person to person. Besides, by following everyone from a list, your feed might become too cluttered. And that might result in missing the valuable information you want to see. Rather than giving you a list, I will explain the method I use to find the right people. Our job isn't to check Twitter every minute, so we can make it more efficient.

### Choosing your interests
Both the design and development world are big, with many subjects and disciplines to choose from. Thus it is important to know what subjects or disciplines interest you. If you start by following every subject from the start you might run into the clutter problem again. Start with picking a few subjects that interest you most. To give you an example, these subjects can be CSS, Javascript, React, Typescript, or TDD. But don't pick too many, start with a number that you are comfortable with. I started with following four to five people for three or four subjects.

### Finding the right people
Once you've chosen your subjects you can start looking for people to follow. How I did this is: I started with looking for influential people of the subjects. These are people who contribute a lot and work on the chosen subject on a daily base. If I use Gatsby, for example, look at people who work at Gatsby itself. Before following them it's important to set several expectations for yourself:
* How often do you want them to tweet that keeps Twitter usable for you? Try to combine more active people with people who might only tweet once or twice a week.
* What type of content do you expect: blogposts, articles, retweets, etc. Know what information you want from Twitter.
* What is the subject / personal life / off-topic ratio that you expect? Everyone is human, so unless it's a professional account, expect other content as well. But do set a ratio for yourself which is acceptable. The best way by finding your ratio is by trying it. You can always unfollow people if you feel that the ratio is off.

Based on this you can scan their Twitter timeline to see if they fit your expectations. If so, hit that follow button! Start small, so do this with max 5 people of each chosen subject.

### Why starting small
The basic idea is to start small. That's also why I don't believe in following a list and follow all those people. By starting small you actually see what everyone tweets. And you can see if the people you follow suit your interests and expectations. The other idea behind starting small is that by following influential people you expand your list based on them. They don't just tweet about their work and views but usually retweet a lot as well. If you see retweets that interest you, check those people's profiles. If they suit your interests you can follow them as well. This way you organically extend your lists and keep it maintainable.

This is how I find the right people to stay up-to-date on Twitter. I hope you find these tips useful. Don't forget there is no perfect formula for this, I still regularly update my Following list!
