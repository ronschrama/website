        I think it is important to have a second passion in addition to my work. I found my passion in cycling. Cycling gives me a sense of freedom and peace of mind. It is a great way to discover your surroundings. It helps me to push my limits, get a breath of fresh air, and gives me inspiration or a way to clear my head at the same time.

        As I said, For me, the bike is a great way to discover my surroundings, but it doesnâ€™t end there for me. Living in the always flat Netherlands made me quickly long for the mountains, that's why I try to book a trip to a beautiful mountain area every year. My ultimate trip was a road trip through parts of Southern Europe. I threw my bike in the back of the car and started a wonderful trip where I combined city trips with riding up beautiful mountains in Spain, France and, Italy.      </p>
